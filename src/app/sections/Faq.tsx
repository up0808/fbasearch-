    question: "What is FbaDevAiSearch?",
    answer:
      "FbaDevAiSearch is an intelligent search platform powered by Google's Gemini AI and real-time web search. It provides comprehensive, contextualized answers by analyzing multiple sources and delivering instant summaries with source citations. Think of it as having a research assistant that understands your questions and finds the most relevant information across the web.",
  },
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "How does FbaDevAiSearch differ from regular search engines?",
    answer:
      "Unlike traditional search engines that show a list of links, FbaDevAiSearch uses AI to understand your question, search multiple sources, synthesize the information, and provide a comprehensive answer with citations. You can also ask follow-up questions in a natural conversation, making research more intuitive and efficient.",
  },
  {
    category: "Features",
    question: "What is conversational search and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Conversational search allows you to have a back-and-forth dialogue with the AI. Each conversation maintains context, so you can ask follow-up questions without repeating information. For example, you can ask 'What is machine learning?' and then follow up with 'How is it used in healthcare?' - the AI remembers your conversation history.",
  },
  {
    category: "Features",
    question: "Can I see the sources for the AI's answers?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Every answer includes transparent source citations. When the AI searches the web, it displays all the URLs it used to generate the response. You can click on any source to verify information or explore topics in more depth. We believe in transparent, verifiable AI.",
  },
  {
    category: "Technical",
    question: "What AI technology powers FbaDevAiSearch?",
    answer:
      "FbaDevAiSearch is powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model for natural language understanding and generation. We integrate Tavily Search API for real-time web research, and deploy on Google Cloud Run for enterprise-grade reliability and performance. The entire system is built with LangGraph for advanced conversational AI workflows.",
  },
  {
    category: "Technical",
    question: "Is my search data private and secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we take privacy seriously. Your searches are processed securely through our API with authentication. We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS), and conversations are stored temporarily using in-memory checkpointing. We don't share your search data with third parties, and you maintain full control over your conversation history.",
  },
  {
    category: "Usage",
    question: "What types of questions can I ask?",
    answer:
      "You can ask virtually anything! From current events and news ('What's happening with AI today?'), to research questions ('Explain quantum computing'), how-to queries ('How do I deploy on Cloud Run?'), comparisons ('Compare React vs Vue'), and conversational follow-ups. The AI works best with clear, specific questions but can handle casual language too.",
  },
  {
    category: "Usage",
    question: "How do I start a new conversation or continue an existing one?",
    answer:
      "Each new search automatically starts a fresh conversation and returns a checkpoint ID. To continue a conversation, simply include the checkpoint ID with your next question. The UI handles this automatically - you'll see your conversation history maintained throughout your session. You can start fresh anytime by clearing the conversation.",
  },
  {
    category: "Performance",
    question: "How fast are the responses?",
    answer:
      "Responses stream in real-time as they're generated! You'll see words appearing instantly, typically within 1-2 seconds of asking your question. Web searches add 2-5 seconds depending on the query. Our infrastructure is optimized with Google Cloud Run in the Mumbai region (Asia) for low-latency performance.",
  },
  {
    category: "Integration",
    question: "Can I integrate FbaDevAiSearch into my own application?",
    answer:
      "Yes! FbaDevAiSearch provides a REST API with server-sent events (SSE) for streaming responses. You can integrate it into web apps, mobile apps, or any platform that supports HTTP requests. API documentation includes authentication, endpoints, and example code in multiple languages. Contact us for API access and integration support.",
  },
  {
    category: "Support",
    question: "What if the AI doesn't understand my question or gives wrong information?",
    answer:
      "If you get unclear results, try rephrasing your question with more specific details. The AI is designed to handle ambiguity, but clearer questions yield better answers. If you spot incorrect information, always verify with the provided source citations. You can also rephrase and ask again, or report issues through our feedback system. We continuously improve based on user feedback.",
  },
  {
    category: "Support",
    question: "Do you offer customer support or documentation?",
    answer:
      "Yes! We provide comprehensive documentation including getting started guides, API reference, integration examples, and troubleshooting tips. For technical support, you can reach us through our contact form or email. We also maintain a knowledge base with tutorials and best practices for getting the most out of FbaDevAiSearch.",
